                <p>Kure (Cur-ee) Beach is Carolina Beach's friendly neighbor to the south.  
                    The town was established in 1870 with Hans Kure's arrival from Denmark.  It now has approximately 2,500 year-round residents.  
                    Many of our guests come back year after year to be welcomed with the old-fashioned Southern hospitality of Kure Beach. 
                     We are mostly a residential community, dotted with many fine oceanfront and ocean view motels, condos and cottages to suit all tastes and budgets, including many luxurious beach homes. 
                      Of course, our beach is wide open and unspoiled; with all the elbowroom you could want for sunbathing, strolling, shelling, surfing or fishing.  </p>

                     In addition to miles of wide, clean beaches, we offer oceanfront and ocean view accommodations ranging from well-maintained 1950's era motels and cottages to upscale beach homes condos and hotels.  
                      Likewise, we have several very good family restaurants.  You'll love the vintage decor and prices of our local restaurants dating back to our early days.  
                      Of course, no trip to Carolina Beach is complete without a visit to the famous Boardwalk where you can grab one of our renowned Britt's donuts, a cold glass of milk or tasty cup of coffee,
                     head for the beach and watch the day come alive. </p>
